/// @notice Funding pool contract. Automatically sends funds to a configurable set of receivers.
///
/// The contract has 3 types of users: the senders, the receivers and the proxies.
///
/// A sender has some funds and a set of addresses of receivers, to whom he wants to send funds
/// and proxies, who he trusts with choice of more receivers.
/// In order to send there are 3 conditions, which must be fulfilled:
///
/// 1. There must be funds on his account in this contract.
///    They can be added with `topUp` and removed with `withdraw`.
/// 2. Total amount sent to the receivers on each block must be set to a non-zero value.
///    This is done with `setAmountPerBlock`.
/// 3. A set of receivers and proxies must be non-empty.
///    Receivers can be added, removed and updated with `setReceiver`, proxies with `setProxy`.
///    Each receiver or proxy has a weight,
///    which is used to calculate how the total sent amount is split.
///
/// Each of these functions can be called in any order and at any time, they have immediate effects.
/// When all of these conditions are fulfilled, on each block the configured amount is being sent.
/// It's extracted from the `withdraw`able balance and transferred to the receivers.
/// The process continues automatically until the sender's balance is empty.
///
/// A receiver has an account, from which he can `collect` funds sent by the senders.
/// The available amount is updated every `cycleBlocks` blocks,
/// so recently sent funds may not be `collect`able immediately.
/// `cycleBlocks` is a constant configured when the pool is deployed.
///
/// A proxy has a list of receivers with attached weights, just like a sender.
/// When a sender is sending some funds to a proxy,
/// they are split and passed to the proxy's receivers according to their weights.
/// The proxy can change its list of receivers at any time with immediate effect,
/// but as if it was done on the beginning of the current cycle.
///
/// A single address can be used as a sender, a receiver and a proxy, even at the same time.
/// It will have 2 balances in the contract, one with funds being sent and one with received,
/// but with no connection between them and no shared configuration.
/// In order to send received funds, they must be first `collect`ed and then `topUp`ped
/// if they are to be sent through the contract.
///
/// The concept of something happening periodically, e.g. every block or every `cycleBlocks` are
/// only high-level abstractions for the user, Ethereum isn't really capable of scheduling work.
/// The actual implementation emulates that behavior by calculating the results of the scheduled
/// events based on how many blocks have been mined and only when a user needs their outcomes.
///
/// The contract assumes that all amounts in the system can be stored in signed 128-bit integers.
/// It's guaranteed to be safe only when working with assets with supply lower than `2 ^ 127`.
